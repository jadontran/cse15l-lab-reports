## Student Submission Examples

### List Methods Corrected
![Image](CorrectStudentSubmission.png)

This submission has the proper methods, therefore it will return a perfect score.

### List Methods Compile Error
![Image](CompileError.png)

This submission has a syntax error of missing a semicolon in a line, therefore it will simply return a "Compile error!" statement.

### List Methods Filename
![Image](FileNotFound.png)

This submission has the correct file with the wrong name, therefore it is not found and will return a "ListExamples.java is not found!" statement.

## Tracing Student Submission (Filename)

* Line 3 : 
    stdout = N/A
    stderr = N/A
    return code = 0
* Line 4 : 
    stdout = N/A
    stderr = N/A
    return code = 0
* Line 5 : 
    stdout = N/A
    stderr = Cloning into â€˜student-submission' . . .
    return code = 0
* Line 6 : 
    stdout = N/A
    stderr = N/A
    return code = 0
* Line 12 : The condition was false because the submission gave the file the wrong name. Thus, no "ListExamples.java" file was found.
* Line 15 :  
    stdout = ListExamples.java is not found!
    stderr = N/A
    return code = 0
* Line 16 :
    stdout = N/A
    stderr = N/A
    return code = 1
* Lines 17-54 : These lines will not run because there is an early exit on Line 16 after it fails to detect a ListExamples.java file.
